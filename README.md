Hi there! This is the GitHub repo for my personal website, hosted at [xiangbei11.github.io](https://xiangbei11.github.io/), built using the awesome [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll template. The website is a place where I share my work, projects, and academic background. Whether you're here to check out my portfolio, read my blog, or just browsing — welcome!

## 🚀 Features

This website includes:

- A clean and professional design
- Dedicated pages for bio, CV, publications, projects, and blog
- Code highlighting, LaTeX support, and citation-ready publications
- Easy customization via YAML and markdown

## 🛠 How to Use

For setup instructions, please refer to the official [al-folio INSTALL.md](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/INSTALL.md) guide. It walks you through everything from installing dependencies to running the site locally or deploying via GitHub Pages.
